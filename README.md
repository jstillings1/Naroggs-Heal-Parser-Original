The issue was always the same one. Range to heal target in game lost a lot of logged heals and finding a way to determine encounter start time and encounter stop time without the player doing dmg to the encounter was never solved.

You might find some very unorthodox regex use as I was Google programming:)
This was originally a  windows forms with a embedded database visual studio 12 project and I did compile and run this on VS 17 just before pushing it.

This heal parser created a lot of fun times for healers but ultimate the logging system was not logging enough information in the healers logs to be able to solve the above issues.

It did however show some of the other loggin programs that AA heals and proc heals needed to be recorded. I am unaware if they ever added them to some more DPS oriented log readers.
